## Authentication System Implementation (2024-02-25)

### AWS Cognito Configuration
1. Set up AWS Cognito User Pool (`us-east-2_1hzrxJhtw`)
2. Created Cognito App Client (`2qa5a4p6g4cth5vg9531c2nhsi`)
3. Configured Identity Pool (`us-east-2:500ec6c3-c9bd-4dc2-8e6e-77f848d4aa19`)
4. Updated environment variables in both frontend and backend

### Backend Changes
1. Implemented Cognito authentication endpoints:
   - `/api/auth/login`
   - `/api/auth/register`
   - `/api/auth/status`
   - `/api/auth/logout`
2. Added proper error handling for Cognito responses
3. Implemented token validation and refresh mechanisms
4. Added Identity Pool integration for AWS service access

### Frontend Changes
1. Created authentication context and hooks:
   - `AuthContext` for global auth state management
   - `useAuth` hook for component-level auth access
2. Implemented login flow with proper token storage
3. Added protected route wrapper for authenticated routes
4. Created user interface components:
   - Login page with email/password form
   - Registration page
   - Dashboard with user info display

### Electron Integration
1. Set up secure IPC communication
2. Configured window security settings:
   ```javascript
   webPreferences: {
       nodeIntegration: false,
       contextIsolation: true,
       sandbox: true,
       webSecurity: true
   }
   ```
3. Added drag-and-drop event handling
4. Implemented folder selection functionality

### Bug Fixes
1. Fixed token validation in `/api/auth/status` endpoint
2. Resolved drag event undefined error in Electron
3. Fixed authentication state synchronization
4. Corrected login redirect behavior

### Current Status
- Basic authentication flow is working
- User can log in and access protected routes
- Token storage and validation implemented
- Electron app security configured
- Identity Pool integration completed

### Next Steps
1. Implement file upload functionality
2. Add user settings management
3. Implement sync mechanism with S3
4. Add file sharing capabilities
5. Enhance error handling and user feedback

## Environment Setup
- Frontend running on port 5001 (Vite dev server)
- Backend running on port 5000 (Flask)
- Electron app configured for development
- AWS credentials and regions properly set

## Dependencies
- Frontend:
  - React with TypeScript
  - Vite for development
  - AWS SDK for JavaScript
  - Amazon Cognito Identity JS
  - React Router for navigation
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Shadcn UI components

- Backend:
  - Flask for API
  - Boto3 for AWS integration
  - Python-dotenv for configuration
  - Flask-CORS for cross-origin support

- Electron:
  - Secure IPC communication
  - Preload scripts for API exposure
  - Window management
  - File system integration

## 2024-03-19: Header UI Improvements

### Changes Made
1. Reorganized header layout for better alignment
   - Moved bucket selector and folder selector to same horizontal line
   - Added "+" button for creating new S3 buckets
   - Ensured consistent height (36px) for all controls

2. Improved error message handling
   - Consolidated duplicate "No bucket selected" messages
   - Moved error message under bucket selector
   - Added proper spacing in header (pb-7) to prevent error message cutoff
   - Used absolute positioning to prevent layout shifts

3. Styling improvements
   - Consistent dark theme colors
   - Better button and input alignments
   - Proper spacing between elements
   - Added hover states and tooltips

### Components Modified
- `Dashboard.tsx`: Updated header layout and padding
- `BucketSelector.tsx`: Improved component structure and error handling

### Next Steps
1. Implement bucket creation functionality
2. Add loading states for bucket operations
3. Consider adding bucket region selection
4. Add validation for bucket names

### Technical Details
- Used Tailwind CSS for styling
- Maintained consistent height with `h-9` class
- Used `relative` and `absolute` positioning for error messages
- Added `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text wrapping

# ZugaCloud Debugging Log

## Process Management Issues - [Date: February 25, 2025]

The development environment was experiencing issues with node processes being forcibly killed during startup. After thorough investigation, we identified and fixed multiple root causes:

1. Import error in backend code
2. Process management chain reaction in dev.py
3. Default behavior of the concurrently npm package
4. Electron window closing behavior

For detailed investigation steps, root cause analysis, and the complete solution, please refer to the [cursor-debugging.md](./cursor-debugging.md) file, section "Node Process Killing During Development".

The application now starts correctly with all components functioning as expected, and the development environment remains stable even when closing the Electron window.
